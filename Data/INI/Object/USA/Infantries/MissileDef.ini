    ;***NOTE***
    ;A little history -- the MissileDefender now uses the assets of the TankHunter. 
    ;The TH uses assets of the GLA tunnel defender, and the TD uses assets of the NEW
    ;MD. It was a design/art/code decision because the new missile defender animations
    ;don't suit that of a mobile/offensive unit with packing and unpacking.
